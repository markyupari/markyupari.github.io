## Mark Yupari - Full Stack Developer

Hello there! My name is Mark Yupari, and this is a short brief of my bio as a web developer.  
I have combined what I have learned at MIT from the course “Full Stack Developer with MERN” with my experience as an automation technician at the international oil industry facility from Repsol.  
During the course, I had the opportunity to develop web pages using HTTP, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and the guide from high levels MIT professors like John Williams and Abel Sanchez.  
My automation experience allowed me to gain expertise in topics like logic and control algorithms development, getting insights using data analysis tools, and system integration from different software components and platforms, as well as soft skills like teamwork, efficient communication, and proactivity.  
With my profile, I can add to the company a lower learning curve and knowledge of automation techniques which makes a more competitive engineer.
